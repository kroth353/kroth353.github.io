			<h2> Basics</h2>
			<p> 
			I am originally from Shaker Heights, Ohio, a town right outside Cleveland. I am a part of the Club Swim Team, for which I was the UDance representative, and the Kappa Alpha Theta Social Sorority. Summer 2023 I had an internship working as a cybersecurity intern in Cleveland, Ohio.

			<h2>Hobbies</h2>

			<p>
				I really enjoy reading, the best book I have read recently is The Inheritance Games by Jennifer Lynn Barnes. I am also a fan of being 	outside and especially hiking. One of my favorite hikes is called the ledges in Cuyahoga Valley National park.On Sundays in the fall I will most likely be sitting in front of some device watching NFL red zone (Go browns!). I really enjoy in my free time is baking. I especially like making different types of loaves, such as banana bread.
