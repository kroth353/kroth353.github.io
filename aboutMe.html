		<h2> Basics</h2>
		<p> 
			I am originally from Shaker Heights, Ohio, a town right outside Cleveland. I am a part of the Club Swim Team, for which I was the UDance representative, and the Kappa Alpha Theta Social Sorority. Summer 2023 I had an internship working as a cybersecurity intern in Cleveland, Ohio.
		</p>
		<h2>Hobbies</h2>
		<p>
			I really enjoy reading, the best book I have read recently is The Inheritance Games by Jennifer Lynn Barnes. I am also a fan of being outside and especially hiking. One of my favorite hikes is called the ledges in Cuyahoga Valley National park. On Sundays in the fall I will most likely be sitting in front of a TV watching NFL red zone (Go browns!). I really enjoy in my free time is baking. I especially like making different types of loaves, such as banana bread.

		<h2>Web Development Interests</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>I find it very fun</li>
			<li>I like the ability to be very specific with design implementation.</li>
			<li>It's a skill that is very relevant, and one I don't see becoming irrelevant</li>
			<li>I can use Web Development skills for self organization in addition to professional purposes.</li>
		</ul>
